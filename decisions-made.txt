We have decided not to use numpy arrays because we can do 
Euler's method fine in two dimensions without them. 
(Atleast not use them for the majority of the 121 course. 
    Maybe it would be fine to introduce them later on. )

Brother Hatt suggested that functions are a little too abstract for PH121 students.
