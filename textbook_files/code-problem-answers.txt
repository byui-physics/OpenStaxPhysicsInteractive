Answer to problem C1. 
CODE:

c = 3e8 # m/s
me = 9.1e-31 # kg

v = 0.999*c

# compute gamma
gamma = (1 - (v/c)**2)**(-0.5)

# compute kinetic energy 
K = (gamma - 1)*me*c**2

eV = K/1.602e-19

print(f'{K:.3g}', f'{eV:.3g}')

OUTPUT: 
1.75e-12 1.09e+07

The first number should be the answer in Joules, and the second is in eV.
