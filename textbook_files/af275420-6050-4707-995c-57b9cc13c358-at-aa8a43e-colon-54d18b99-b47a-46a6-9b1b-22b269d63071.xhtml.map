Lasers can also be produced by a large range of gain medium materials, including solids (for example, the ruby crystal), gases (helium-gas mixture), plasmas, and liquids (organic dyes). Recently, a laser was even created using gelatinâan edible laser!

The width of the track is smaller than 1/20th the width of a human hair, and the heights of the bumps are even smaller yet.</p>\n<div class=\"os-figure\"><figure id=\"CNX_UPhysics_41_06_CD\" data-sm=\"./modules/m62593/index.cnxml:35:1\">\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"fs-id1170902618424\" data-alt=\"An illustration of the details of a compact disc.

Laser light is suited to this purpose, because coherent light can be focused onto an incredibly small spot and therefore distinguish between bumps and pits in the CD. After processing by player components (including a diffraction grating, polarizer, and collimator), laser light is focused by a lens onto the CD surface. Light that strikes a bump (âlandâ) is merely reflected, but light that strikes a âpitâ destructively interferes, so no light returns (the details of this process are not important to this discussion). Reflected light is interpreted as a â1â and unreflected light is interpreted as a â0.â The resulting digital signal is converted into an analog signal, and the analog signal is fed into an amplifier that powers a device such as a pair of headphones.

Uses such as cutting, drilling, and engraving require much more power. And applications such as laser-induced nuclear fusion require extraordinary he power and intensity. However, creating more intense lasers â on the order of gigawatts per square centimeter â is not simply a matter of finding better materials and increasing the power supply, because ultra-intense laser pulses have a fundamental complication: they can reduce the quality of the laser beam and even damage the laser device itself.</p>\n  <p id=\"fs-id1170902720060d\" data-sm=\"./modules/m62593/index.cnxml:61:3\">The details of these outcomes are beyond the scope of this chapter, but are results of optical processes that lead to the laser beam actually collapsing (losing its attributes), a significant rise in temperature within the gain medium (damaging the medium), or reflection that could damage the laserâs components. For decades, avoiding these processes required extremely large laser facilities and limits on laser intensity, both of which prohibited advances in scientific and societal outcomes.</p>\n  <p id=\"fs-id1170902720060e\" data-sm=\"./modules/m62593/index.cnxml:62:3\">In the 1980s, Donna Strickland and GÃ©rard Mourou developed a process to overcome these issues. Their method uses ultrashort laser pulses passed over gratings, which modify the beam and make it safe for amplification. The diffraction gratings essentially split the initial pulses into high- and low-frequency components, and âstretchâ them prior to entry into the gain medium. Once safely amplified (by factors of millions or more) the components are recombined, and the beam continues to its target.</p>\n  <p id=\"fs-id1170902720060f\" data-sm=\"./modules/m62593/index.cnxml:63:3\">Chirped pulse amplification (CPA), as the process became known, has been used to develop most of the highest-powered lasers in the world, but also some of the smallest and most common. Decades after their initial discovery, Strickland and Mourou were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics, with Strickland becoming the third woman to receive the award. Mourou was an established innovator in laser research (having discovered one of the problems that CPA helped overcome), and Strickland built the chirped pulse laser as a part of PhD thesis.</p>\n  <p id=\"fs-id1170902720060g\" data-sm=\"./modules/m62593/index.cnxml:64:3\">CPA has had a pivotal role in the increasingly common practice of laser vision correction â an application neither planned during their initial research. It is also used to create many devices we use every day, such as precision-cutting the durable glass used in smartphones. CPA is used in cancer treatment to target tumors without impacting surrounding tissue (the ultrashort, high-intensity beams are particularly effective). And it is used in a type of fusion â inertial confinement fusion â where extremely powerful lasers compress and heat targets to trigger nuclear fusion.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  </div>\n  </body>\n</html>",null,null]}
