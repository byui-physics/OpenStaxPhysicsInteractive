<section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Using Computers To Do Physics</h3>

<p>While physics is about describing the fundamental interactions that govern our world, being able to quantify things with numbers and make numerical predictions is a valuable tool. 
    It's what gives physics the ability to be useful in the everyday world. Much of the calculation we do in physics enlists the aid of computers. Being able to let 
    the tool worry about the numbers gives us more time to think about the principles and the problems we are trying to solve.
</p>

<p>Many of the problems we will solve in this course will be simple problems designed to help you learn the principles. How do we scale up the things we learn to problems that need solving in the real world?
    We break hard problems into smaller simple problems. Though it might take us a long time to solve many simple problems over and over, if we can solve the problem once, we can make a computer repeat the calculations over
    until we have a solution for the larger more difficult problem. Many numerical methods are built on the principle of breaking a difficult problem into a smaller easier problem that can be repeated over and over. 
</p>

<p>
    One example of a computing tool that is commonly used in Physics is Python. Python is a programming language that is fairly easy to learn. Python is just a calculator, though an extremely powerful one. 
    In this text, we will use Python to do numerical calculations as part
    of our physics experience. There is much one can learn with python, but to get started we only need a few basics. 
</p>

</section>

<section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Variables And Arithmetic In Python</h3>


<p>The first thing we need to learn about is variables. When we are doing physics, we will want to assign labels for certain quantities. For example, we often use the letter 
    <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span>
    to represent the speed of an object. An object may have a specific number for its speed (such as 3 m/s), but to help us remember what the number means, and to keep our focus on the principles,
    we write <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span>. 
    In python we can set that letter to hold the value of 3 m/s for us so we can just remember the <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span>. 
    Below is a python code that sets <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span> to the number 
    we want and saves it for us. Press the run button to run the python code. 
</p>

<python-code-cell>v = 3 # m/s</python-code-cell>
<p>Python doesn't actually keep track of the m/s, only the number 3. Notice the hashtag symbol. It tells python to ignore everything after that on the row. These hashtags are used in python
    to create code comments. They don't talk to the computer, only the human reading the code. 
I used it here to remind myself that <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span> is measured in meters per second.
</p>

<p>In physics we will need to plug in numbers to equations that we derive. When we solve problems in physics, we often come up with an equation that gives the result we are looking for. As an example, the final location of
    a moving truck (traveling with a speed of <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span>) is <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><mo>&#x0003D;</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>0</mi></msub><mo>&#x0002B;</mo><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></math></span>. 
    The symbol <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>f</mi></msub></mrow></math></span>
    represents the final position, which is what we are looking for. The symbol <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></math></span>
    represents the time that the truck has been moving since it was at its original position, which is represented by the symbol <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math></span>.
    The different variables in the equation represent numbers, but we let the computer plug them in for us. For this we will need to store values for <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>t</mi></mrow></math></span>
    and for <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math></span> like we did earlier for <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow></math></span>.
    Below is a python code that stores the original numbers and calculates the final answer. 
</p>

<python-code-cell># store initial position (starting at 0 meters)
x0 = 0 # m/s

# store time of travel
t = 30 # seconds

# calculate the final position
xf = x0 + v*t

# print the results
print(xf)
</python-code-cell>

<p>Notice that since we stored the velocity earlier, we didn't need to store it again. The code remembered it from earlier (if you ran the code earlier). In 
    this textbook, each page will remember code that was ran earlier on the same page.
</p>

<p>Also notice in the code that once we have the equation that gives our answer, all we need to do is type it in. Typing equations into python is 
    very straight forward and looks much like the way we write them when we are coming up with the equations. 
</p>

<p>Let's go over how to use the most common arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. 
    The first four are as you might expect. To raise a variable to a power in python, you use a double asterisk. Python follows the order of operations,
    and you can insert parenthesis to help you keep the order straight. Below is an example.  
</p>

<python-code-cell># some example variables
a = 3.2
b = 0.97

# simple arithmetic
c = a + b 
c = b - a 
c = a * b 
c = b / a 
c = a**b # raise a to the b power
c = a**0.5 # the square root of a 

# order of operations
c = (a*b+0.5*a)/4
</python-code-cell>

<p>Python also has access to functions that perform other mathematical operations we are used to. Many of these come from a library called numpy. 
    From numpy we can find logarithm functions, trigonometry functions, square root functions, and others. Below is an example. 
</p>

<python-code-cell>from numpy import sin, cos, tan, arctan, pi, sqrt, log, log10

# trig functions are in radians. 
theta = 30 # degrees 
theta = 30 * 180/pi # use pi to convert to radians (rewriting over theta)
c = sin(theta)
c = cos(theta)
c = tan(theta)
c = arctan(b/a) # inverse tangent function

c = log(a) # natural log (ln)
c = log10(b) # common log (base 10)

c = sqrt(a) # another way to do square root
</python-code-cell>

<p>For now, this is a good start. We will learn more tricks throughout our physics journey that will allow us to break difficult problems into simpler ones.
    As you move forward, we will provide python cells in the text for you to use like this for you to compute answers to the problems you are working on. As the problems
    get harder, we will introduce more things you can do in python to make the tool more useful. We invite you to practice with it now, even when the problems are simple. 
</p>

 <section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Making Plots</h3>

    <p>In python it is relatively simple to make plots. To do this, we will use the pyplot function from the matplotlib library. Pyplot doesn't plot functions, instead it plots points;
        it requires a collection of x values and y values. In order to give pyplot the x and y values we need to know how to use a python list. A list in python is an object that can contain 
        several values. Lists in python are surrounded by square brackets, and the values are seperated by a comma. Below is an example of how we might use lists to store our x and y values. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>xpoints = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
ypoints = [9, 4, 1, 4, 9, 16]
    </python-code-cell>

    <p>Now that we have lists for our x and y points, we can make a plot. Below shows an example of a simple plot using our lists.</p>

    <python-code-cell>from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
# the 'as' tells python to rename pyplot to plt for easier typing

plt.clf() # clear any previous drawings
plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show() # show the results
    </python-code-cell>

    <p>By default pyplot will connect the dots. If you don't want the dots connected, you can add <code>'.'</code> as a third argument in the plot command, giving us
        <code>plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints, '.')</code>.</p>

    <p>Letting pyplot connect the dots can be useful for plotting functions. However, with only 5 points, the curve is not very smooth. 
        Additionally, it can be pretty tedious to type out every point that we want to plot. Luckily for us, there is a function in numpy that will give us a list 
        of points. The function is called linspace. It takes in a starting point, an ending point, and how many points we want to create in that range. 
        Actually, the linspace function 
        gives us a special kind of list called an array. Arrays are a little different than lists, but they can still be used to plot a collection of points. 
        One advantage of using an array is that we can put the array into our equation for the function we are tying to plot, and it will return an array of the y values. 
        Below demonstrates using arrays to plot the function <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00028;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00029;</mo><mo>&#x0003D;</mo><mn>3</mn><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>&#x02212;</mo><mn>12</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>&#x0002B;</mo><mn>13</mn></mrow></math></span>. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>from numpy import linspace

# use linspace to make a list of 100 x points
xpoints = linspace(0, 5, 100)

# put xpoints array into our equation to make y points
ypoints = 3*xpoints**2 - 12*xpoints + 13

# plot the points 
plt.clf()
plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()
    </python-code-cell>

<p>Notice how by using arrays, we were able to make our curve much smoother. While arrays are quite useful, 
    there are other methods we can use to systematically create a list of x points and y points. We will explore more later on. </p>

                        If you want to add a second line to the plot, all you need to do is insert a new <code>plt.plot()</code> function after the first one, using 
                        a new set of x and y lists. Modify the code above to add a second line representing the function <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00028;</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">&#x00029;</mo><mo>&#x0003D;</mo><mn>3</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>&#x0002B;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math></span>. 
                        You will need to create a second list of y points (call it <code>ypoints2</code>), but you can reuse the same x points list if you would like.
