<section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Vectors in python using arrays</h3>

    <p>On common way to create a vector in python is with something called an array. An array is an object with a set number of entries. To create an array in python, we have to import it from a library called numpy. 
        For our vectors in this class, these arrays might only have two or three entries when used to represent vectors in two or three dimensions. 
        However, later on we may use arrays to hold more than just two or three numbers. We can create a position vector using an array as shown
        in the example code below. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell># creating a vector using arrays
from numpy import array

# defining two vectors in 3D
x0 = array([300.0, 200.0, 100.0]) # m
xf = array([1200, 2100, 250]) # m

print(x0, xf)
    </python-code-cell>

    <p>Notice that when making arrays, we have to use the parenthesis and the square brackets around the vector entries. Once we have an array we can get the components out of it
        by putting square brackets after the name of the variable, and the index of the entry we want. Watch out because python starts counting from 0, so the first index of
        your vector is 0 and the second is 1. Below is an example. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell># getting x and y components of a vector
xcomp = x0[0] # get x component of x0
ycomp = x0[1] # get y component of x0
print(xcomp, ycomp)
    </python-code-cell>


    <p>We can easily multiply/divide vectors by scalars in python. When you multiply or divide an array by a number, each entry in the array gets multiplied/divided by that number. Using arrays, we can also easily add and subtract
        vectors from each other. When arrays have the same number of entries, subtracting vector from another subtracts each element of one from the corresponding element of the other. Below demonstrates both
        of these types of vector arithmetic. The example uses these to calculate an average velocity (vector) from a displacement (vector) and a time (scalar).  
    </p>

    <python-code-cell># vector addition/subtraction
displacement = xf - x0
print(displacement)

# scalar multiplication/division 
t = 5 # s 
v = displacement/t 
print()
    </python-code-cell>

<section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Polar and cartesian coordinates</h3>

    <p>Often it is easier to stay in cartesian coordinates when using vectors in python, whereas polar coordinates are more useful in setting up the problem in our algebra work.
        However, being able to calculate the magnitude of a vector or it's angle are useful things to be able to do. Being able to convert a vector from polar to cartesian is also something
        we will have to do often. 
    </p>

    <p>Let's first consider how we might convert a vector from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates. Recall how in section 2.3 we used trigonometry to convert from polar to cartesian. In python, we can import 
        our trigonometry functions from numpy, the same library we used to get arrays. Python trigonometry functions work with radians, so we will also import pi from numpy to allow us to convert. Below is an example. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>from numpy import sin, cos, pi

# start with magnitude and angle
mag = 10
theta = 30 # degrees, north of east 

# convert angle to radians 
theta = theta * pi / 180 # this rewrites over the previous theta value

# create the vector using the components calculated with sin and cos
vec = array([mag*cos(theta), mag*sin(theta)])

print(vec)
    </python-code-cell>

    <p>When converting a vector from cartesian back to polar, we typically compute the magnitude using the pythagorean theorem, and we compute the angle using the arctangent function. However, the arctangent function only
        returns angles in the first and fourth quadrants, so if our vector should be in the second or third quadrant, our angle will be wrong. Python has an improved arctan2 function that accounts for this issue. The arctan2 function
        requires us to give the opposite component first, and then the adjacent component. It returns the answer in radians, so we may want to convert back to degrees when we are done. 
        The code below transforms our new cartesian vector back to the polar form we started with. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>from numpy import arctan2, sqrt 

# calculate the magnitude
mag = sqrt(vec[0]**2 + vec[1]**2)

# calculate the angle 
theta = arctan2(vec[1], vec[0])
theta = theta * 180 / pi # convert to degrees

print(mag, theta)
    </python-code-cell>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have noticed that when doing all these calculations, the answer we got was not exactly what we started with. When doing calculations, small errors can build up because the computer can 
        only keep track of so many digits. However, most of the time we only care about the first few significant digits, so this isn't a big issue. 
    </p>

    <p>Numpy also has inverse sine and cosine functions that we may use, for example if we want to find the angle between two vectors. You can import these the same way you would the regular sin and cos functions. 
        In numpy they are called arcsin and arccos. 
    </p>

    <h3 data-type="title">Vector products in python</h3>

<p>Most of the time in this class, we will want to compute our vector products by hand symbolically before plugging it into python. This is because vector products represent principles of physics, and also because 
    often times much simplification can be done when doing them by hand. Because of this, being able to convert from cartesian to polar in python will be much more useful. 
    However, there are functions from numpy that we can use to calculate the dot and cross product of two vectors. To compute the dot product of two vectors you can use the @ symbol between the two vectors. 
    To compute cross products, we can use the cross function also imported from the numpy library. However, this cross function follows 
<a href="d50f6e32-0fda-46ef-a362-9bd36ca7c97d-at-aa8a43e-colon-062a33ff-f006-4a59-a5ac-0ac8c9313483.html#fs-id1167131238839" target="_blank">Equation 2.40,</a> and may not help in every problem. 
The cross product here only works with vectors in 3D.
Below is an example of how one might compute these, incase you ever choose to use it. </p>

<python-code-cell>F1 = array([10.0, -20.4, 2.0])
F2 = array([-15.0, 0.0, -6.2])

# Computing a dot product
dotproduct = F1 @ F2
print(dotproduct)

# Computing a cross product 
from numpy import cross 
crossproduct = cross(F1, F2)
print(crossproduct)
</python-code-cell>

<section data-depth="1"><h3 data-type="title">Moving forward</h3>

    <p>By now you may be thinking that this is a lot to remember. The goal of this section and of the <a href="pythonchapter_pythonjumpstart.html">previous code section</a> was 
        to get you familiar with how variables work in python and how we can use them to do calculations. Moving forward there will be a lot more that we can include in our python code 
        to do different things. Don't feel like you must memorize it all. The goal of using python in physics is to allow us to explore the principles in more ways. 
    </p>

    <p>In this course, most of the code will be provided for you. We will provide tools that you should feel free to play with as you explore the principles. Having learned some basics about how variables work, 
        you should be able to make changes to the variables and alter the code to fit your needs. 
    </p>

    <p>If you want to write your own code, you can always reference the code provided in this book. For further details see <a href="https://lancejnelson.github.io/PH135/" target="_blank">Scientific Computing by Lance J. Nelson.</a></p>

    <!-- This is a more in depth explaination, but I felt like it was getting too long and explaining things we weren't going to use in PH121. -->
    <!-- <p>Much of the time we will want to compute vector products by hand as part of our algebra work. Often vector products represent principles that we need to apply to our work before plugging in numbers. 
        However, there are times when we may want to compute the vector product numerically. In these cases, we can use python to compute vector products. The scalar product or dot product can be computed between two arrays of equal length. 
        To compute a scalar product, use the @ symbol between the two vectors. Below is an example. 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>F1 = array([10.0, -20.4, 2.0])
F2 = array([-15.0, 0.0, -6.2])

# computing the scalar product (dot product)
scalarproduct = F1 @ F2 

print(scalarproduct)
    </python-code-cell>
    <p>If we wanted to find the angle between two vectors <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">A</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="true">&#x02192;</mo></mover></mrow></math></span> and 
        <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">B</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="true">&#x02192;</mo></mover></mrow></math></span>, 
        we could use the equation discussed in the last section <span class="os-math-in-para"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mi>&#x003B8;</mi><mo>&#x0003D;</mo><msup><mi>cos</mi><mrow><mo>&#x02212;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="prefix">&#x00028;</mo><mfrac><mrow><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">A</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="true">&#x02192;</mo></mover><mover><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">B</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="true">&#x02192;</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>B</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo stretchy="true" fence="true" form="postfix">&#x00029;</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span>. 
        Doing this in python would look like 
    </p>

    <python-code-cell>from numpy import arccos # inverse cosine function 

# first calculate magnitudes 
magF1 = sqrt(F1[0]**2 + F1[1]**2 + F1[2]**2)
magF2 = sqrt(F2[0]**2 + F2[1]**2 + F2[2]**2)

theta = arccos( (F1 @ F2) / (magF1 * magF2))

# convert angle to degrees
theta = theta * 180 / pi

print(theta)
    </python-code-cell>

    <p>
        We can also compute vector products (or cross products) in python. Recall from the last section that there are two ways of computing the cross product. 
        Now that we know how to use the trig functions from numpy, and how to compute the magnitude of a vector, using <a href="d50f6e32-0fda-46ef-a362-9bd36ca7c97d-at-aa8a43e-colon-062a33ff-f006-4a59-a5ac-0ac8c9313483.html#fs-id1167131455204" target="_blank">Equation 2.35</a> should be pretty straight forward. 
        Though most of the time we will use this equation when doing our algebra by hand (by plugging in the right side of the equation wherever we see the left side). 
        For more general vectors in 3D we can use <a href="d50f6e32-0fda-46ef-a362-9bd36ca7c97d-at-aa8a43e-colon-062a33ff-f006-4a59-a5ac-0ac8c9313483.html#fs-id1167131238839" target="_blank">Equation 2.40,</a> and this 
        is one that we might want to hand to a computer. Below is an example of how we could compute the cross product of two vectors in python using Equation 2.40.
