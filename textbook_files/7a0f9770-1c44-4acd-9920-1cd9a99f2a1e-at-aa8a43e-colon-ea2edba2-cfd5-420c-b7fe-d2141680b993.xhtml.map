It can be easily dislodged; it then moves to a neighboring atom. In a large mass of copper atoms (such as a copper wire or a sheet of copper), these vast numbers of outermost electrons (one per atom) wander from atom to atom, and are the electrons that do the moving when electricity flows.

Even if excess charge is added to an insulating material, it cannot move, remaining indefinitely in place. This is why insulating materials exhibit the electrical attraction and repulsion forces described earlier, whereas conductors do not; any excess charge placed on a conductor would instantly flow away (due to mutual repulsion from existing charges), leaving no excess charge around to create forces. Charge cannot flow along or through an <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term-00003\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:29:644\" group-by=\"i\">insulator</span>, so its electric forces remain for long periods of time.

As mentioned, the conduction electrons in the conductor are able to move with nearly complete freedom. As a result, when a charged insulator (such as a positively charged glass rod) is brought close to the conductor, the (total) charge on the insulator exerts an electric force on the conduction electrons. Since the rod is positively charged, the conduction electrons (which themselves are negatively charged) are attracted, flowing toward the insulator to the near side of the conductor (<a href=\"#CNX_UPhysics_22_02_Induction\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:33:638\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure 5.10</a>).</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1172101914334\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:34:1\">Now, the conductor is still overall electrically neutral; the conduction electrons have changed position, but they are still in the conducting material. However, the conductor now has a charge <em data-effect=\"italics\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:34:224\">distribution</em>; the near end (the portion of the conductor closest to the insulator) now has more negative charge than positive charge, and the reverse is true of the end farthest from the insulator. The relocation of negative charges to the near side of the conductor results in an overall positive charge in the part of the conductor farthest from the insulator. We have thus created an electric charge distribution where one did not exist before. This process is referred to as <em data-effect=\"italics\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:34:741\">inducing polarization</em>—in this case, polarizing the conductor. The resulting separation of positive and negative charge is called <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term-00004\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:34:908\" group-by=\"p\">polarization</span>, and a material, or even a molecule, that exhibits polarization is said to be polarized.

(a) A positive object brought near a neutral insulator polarizes its molecules. There is a slight shift in the distribution of the electrons orbiting the molecule, with unlike charges being brought nearer and like charges moved away. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, there is a net attraction. (b) A negative object produces the opposite polarization, but again attracts the neutral object. (c) The same effect occurs for a conductor; since the unlike charges are closer, there is a net attraction.</span>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"fs-id1172099545335\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:49:1\">When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus, a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally uniform charge distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1172102142188\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:50:1\">When the two ends of a dipole can be separated, this method of <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term-00006\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:50:94\" group-by=\"c\">charging by induction</span> may be used to create charged objects without transferring charge.

The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere to the ground. Since Earth is large and most of the ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by induction, and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge.</p>\n<div class=\"os-figure\"><figure id=\"CNX_UPhysics_22_02_ChgInd2\" data-sm=\"./modules/m58413/index.cnxml:58:1\">\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"fs-id1172099542304\" data-alt=\"In part a, a rod with positive sign is brought near a neutral metal sphere.
