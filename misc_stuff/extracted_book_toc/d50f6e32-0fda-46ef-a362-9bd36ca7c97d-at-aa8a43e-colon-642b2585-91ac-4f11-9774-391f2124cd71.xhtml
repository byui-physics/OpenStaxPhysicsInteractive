<p id="fs-id1168328317120" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:16:1">The origin of Earth’s ocean tides has been a subject of continuous investigation for over 2000 years. But the work of Newton is considered to be the beginning of the true understanding of the phenomenon. Ocean tides are the result of gravitational tidal forces. These same tidal forces are present in any astronomical body. They are responsible for the internal heat that creates the volcanic activity on Io, one of Jupiter’s moons, and the breakup of stars that get too close to black holes.</p>

This is caused by a combination of Earth’s rotation about its axis and the gravitational attraction of both the Moon and the Sun.</p>

One side of Earth is closer to the Moon than the other side, by a distance equal to Earth’s diameter. Hence, the gravitational force is greater on the near side than on the far side. The magnitude at the center of Earth is between these values. This is why a tidal bulge appears on both sides of Earth.</p>

<p id="fs-id1168327886893" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:34:1">Why does the rise and fall of the tides occur twice per day? Look again at <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_13_06_MoonTides" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:34:106" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 13.22</a>. If Earth were not rotating and the Moon was fixed, then the bulges would remain in the same location on Earth. Relative to the Moon, the bulges stay fixed—along the line connecting Earth and the Moon. But Earth rotates (in the direction shown by the blue arrow) approximately every 24 hours. In 6 hours, the near and far locations of Earth move to where the low tides are occurring, and 6 hours later, those locations are back to the high-tide position. Since the Moon also orbits Earth approximately every 28 days, and in the same direction as Earth rotates, the time between high (and low) tides is actually about 12.5 hours. The actual timing of the tides is complicated by numerous factors, the most important of which is another astronomical body—the Sun.</p>

<p id="fs-id1168325631618" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:38:1">In addition to the Moon’s tidal forces on Earth’s oceans, the Sun exerts a tidal force as well. The gravitational attraction of the Sun on any object on Earth is nearly 200 times that of the Moon. However, as we show later in an example, the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:38:273">tidal</em> effect of the Sun is less than that of the Moon, but a significant effect nevertheless.

<p id="fs-id1168328303878" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:55:1">The magnitude of the tides, however, is far more complicated. The relative angles of Earth and the Moon determine spring and neap tides, but the magnitudes of these tides are affected by the distances from Earth as well. Tidal forces are greater when the distances are smaller. Both the Moon’s orbit about Earth and Earth’s orbit about the Sun are elliptical, so a spring tide is exceptionally large if it occurs when the Moon is at perigee and Earth is at perihelion. Conversely, it is relatively small if it occurs when the Moon is at apogee and Earth is at aphelion.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168328214407" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:56:1">The greatest causes of tide variation are the topography of the local shoreline and the bathymetry (the profile of the depth) of the ocean floor. The range of tides due to these effects is astounding.

Note that the forces exerted by the Sun are nearly 200 times greater than the forces exerted by the Moon. But the <em data-effect="italics" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:81:115">difference</em> in those forces for the Sun is half that for the Moon. This is the nature of tidal forces. The Moon has a greater tidal effect because the fractional change in distance from the near side to the far side is so much greater for the Moon than it is for the Sun.

<p id="fs-id1168325697191" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:96:1">Tidal forces exist between any two bodies. The effect stretches the bodies along the line between their centers. Although the tidal effect on Earth’s seas is observable on a daily basis, long-term consequences cannot be observed so easily. One consequence is the dissipation of rotational energy due to friction during flexure of the bodies themselves. Earth’s rotation rate is slowing down as the tidal forces transfer rotational energy into heat. The other effect, related to this dissipation and conservation of angular momentum, is called “locking” or tidal synchronization. It has already happened to most moons in our solar system, including Earth’s Moon. The Moon keeps one face toward Earth—its rotation rate has locked into the orbital rate about Earth. The same process is happening to Earth, and eventually it will keep one face toward the Moon. If that does happen, we would no longer see tides, as the tidal bulge would remain in the same place on Earth, and half the planet would never see the Moon. However, this locking will take many billions of years, perhaps not before our Sun expires.</p>
<p id="fs-id1168328293060" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:97:1">One of the more dramatic example of tidal effects is found on <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis" id="term-00004" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:97:93">Io</span>, one of Jupiter’s moons.

<p id="fs-id1168328066616" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:102:254">For some stars, the effect of tidal forces can be catastrophic. The tidal forces in very close binary systems can be strong enough to rip matter from one star to the other, once the tidal forces exceed the cohesive self-gravitational forces that hold the stars together. This effect can be seen in normal stars that orbit nearby compact stars, such as neutron stars or black holes. <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_13_06_accretion" data-sm="./modules/m58351/index.cnxml:102:666" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 13.27</a> shows an artist’s rendition of this process.
