The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_24_06_VanGraaf2" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:18:409" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 7.41</a> shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs use both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages.</p>
<p id="fs-id1167586176810" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:19:1">A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits.</p>

This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outside surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities.</span>

  <span data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:34:1" class="os-caption">Xerography is a dry copying process based on electrostatics. The major steps in the process are the charging of the photoconducting drum, transfer of an image, creating a positive charge duplicate, attraction of toner to the charged parts of the drum, and transfer of toner to the paper. Not shown are heat treatment of the paper and cleansing of the drum for the next copy.</span>

Selenium is a substance with an interesting property—it is a <span data-type="term" id="term-00003" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:36:199">photoconductor</span>. That is, selenium is an insulator when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light.</p>
<p id="fs-id1167586053689" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:37:1">In the first stage of the xerography process, the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium. In the second stage, the surface of the drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied. In locations where the image is light, the selenium becomes conducting, and the positive charge is neutralized. In dark areas, the positive charge remains, so the image has been transferred to the drum.</p>
<p id="fs-id1167585967933" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:38:1">The third stage takes a dry black powder, called toner, and sprays it with a negative charge so that it is attracted to the positive regions of the drum. Next, a blank piece of paper is given a greater positive charge than on the drum so that it will pull the toner from the drum. Finally, the paper and electrostatically held toner are passed through heated pressure rollers, which melt and permanently adhere the toner to the fibers of the paper.</p>

<p id="fs-id1167585991488" data-sm="./modules/m58778/index.cnxml:60:1">Electrostatic painting employs electrostatic charge to spray paint onto oddly shaped surfaces. Mutual repulsion of like charges causes the paint to fly away from its source. Surface tension forms drops, which are then attracted by unlike charges to the surface to be painted. Electrostatic painting can reach hard-to-get-to places, applying an even coat in a controlled manner. If the object is a conductor, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface, tending to bring the drops in perpendicularly. Corners and points on conductors will receive extra paint. Felt can similarly be applied.</p>
