<p id="fs-id1172100840580" data-sm="./modules/m58391/index.cnxml:17:1">In this section, we explore the thermal behavior of gases. Our word “gas” comes from the Flemish word meaning “chaos,” first used for vapors by the seventeenth-century chemist J. B. van Helmont. The term was more appropriate than he knew, because gases consist of molecules moving and colliding with each other at random. This randomness makes the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic domains simpler for gases than for liquids or solids.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100957007" data-sm="./modules/m58391/index.cnxml:18:1">How do gases differ from solids and liquids? Under ordinary conditions, such as those of the air around us, the difference is that the molecules of gases are much farther apart than those of solids and liquids. Because the typical distances between molecules are large compared to the size of a molecule, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_19_01_AtomsinGas" data-sm="./modules/m58391/index.cnxml:18:354" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.2</a>, the forces between them are considered negligible, except when they come into contact with each other during collisions. Also, at temperatures well above the boiling temperature, the motion of molecules is fast, and the gases expand rapidly to occupy all of the accessible volume. In contrast, in liquids and solids, molecules are closer together, and the behavior of molecules in liquids and solids is highly constrained by the molecules’ interactions with one another. The macroscopic properties of such substances depend strongly on the forces between the molecules, and since many molecules are interacting, the resulting “many-body problems” can be extremely complicated (see <a href="af275420-6050-4707-995c-57b9cc13c358-at-aa8a43e-colon-54c6e1c5-5b90-4bc9-9148-0e6325a00177.html" data-sm="./modules/m58391/index.cnxml:18:1086" data-book-uuid="af275420-6050-4707-995c-57b9cc13c358" data-book-slug="university-physics-volume-3" data-page-slug="9-introduction">Condensed Matter Physics</a>).</p>

The tire’s volume first increases in direct proportion to the amount of air injected, without much increase in the tire pressure. Once the tire has expanded to nearly its full size, the tire’s walls limit its volume expansion. If we continue to pump air into the tire, the pressure increases. When the car is driven and the tires flex, their temperature increases, and therefore the pressure increases even further (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_19_01_FlatTire" data-sm="./modules/m58391/index.cnxml:27:1324" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 2.3</a>).</p>

More surprisingly, when the proportionalities are combined into a single equation, the constant of proportionality is independent of the composition of the gas.
